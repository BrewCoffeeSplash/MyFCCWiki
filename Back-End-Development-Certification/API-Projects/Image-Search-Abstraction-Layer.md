### Objective:

Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: <https://shurli.herokuapp.com/> and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10> and browse recent search queries like this: <https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/>. Then deploy it to Heroku.

As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running `git commit -am "your commit message"`. Note that you should replace "your commit message" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.

You can push these new commits to GitHub by running `git push origin master`, and to Heroku by running `grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku`.

## User Stories:

- I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

## Environment Variables

While heroku can use them as is, cloud9 needs extra work to get them from the `.env` file that you would create.

## Notes

The Bing search api is a pain. I recommend using a npm package to handle it, there are many and I listed one of them. You will also have to sign up to get a key which I recommend using from the `.env` file as to not leak your key. It has a main key but it is better to create a new one that you can delete if it gets compromised, because the main one can't be changed.

Learning about Mongoose was fun. Basically you have to require it, create a scheme, turn it into a model and then youc an use it to create documents.

1- Require Mongoose and declare Schema.

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
```

2- Create Schema

```javascript
var kittySchema = mongoose.Schema({
    name: String
});
```

3- Turn the schema into a model, and connect to it.

```javascript
var Kitten = mongoose.model('Kitten', kittySchema);
var mongouri = process.env.MONGOLAB_URI || "mongodb://" + process.env.IP + ":27017/img-sal";
mongoose.connect(mongouri);
```

While you can do 1 to 3 on the server like I did, the step for and any other can be done anywhere else as long as you know how to export the model.

4- Create new documents based on the model

```javascript
var silence = new Kitten({ name: 'Silence' });
console.log(silence.name); // 'Silence'
```

How to export the model to my api.

```javascript
api(app, Kitten);
```

then on the api file: `module.exports = function(app, History) {`

The search and find can be found on the documentation along with the rest of teh steps I have listed aside from exporting.
