# Finding a Remainder in Javascript
The _remainder operator_ `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

## Example

```
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
```

## Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

```
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
```

**Note** Do not confuse it with _modulus_ `%` does not work well with negative numbers.
